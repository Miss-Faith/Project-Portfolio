    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm curious and innovative by nature. I  have worked as a business analyst at Deloitte where I enjoyed analyzing data and developing solutions. At Equity Bank, I acquired knowledge in banking and insurance. A world exists through the internet that is larger than my current surrounding and coding presents an interesting perspective on problem solving.</p>
